CS217 Lab 3 Report

1.

2. Both my current (privatized) implementation and previous (naive)
implementation fails when n (the number of bins) exceeds 12288. At the time of
writing this report, the cause for this is unknown and I can't think of an
implementation that overcomes this. (The answer to this question, of course, 
will be updated as soon as I can think of one).
